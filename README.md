MobiFallDataset v2.0 is a time-series dataset for human activity and fall detection research, collected from smartphone sensors placed in the trouser pocket of 31 subjects. It includes **daily activities (ADLs)** like walking, jogging, sitting, and stair climbing, along with **simulated falls** such as forward-lying, knee impacts, and sideward falls. Each activity is recorded using **accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation sensors**, with filenames indicating the activity type, sensor used, subject ID, and trial number. Subjects **12–21, 29–31** performed only fall activities. The dataset supports machine learning applications in fall detection, activity recognition, and wearable sensor analysis.
